Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language. Developed by Sun Microsystems - 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak.
Java is a programming language and a platform. Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java.
The current stable release of Java is Java SE 10.

There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:
- <ins>Standalone Application</ins> (Desktop Applications)
Traditional software that we need to install on every machine.
Examples: Media player, Antivirus
AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.

- <ins>Web Application</ins>
Runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page on client.
Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. are used for creating web applications.

- <ins>Enterprise Application</ins>
An application that is distributed in nature. Offers benefits like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering.
Examples: Banking Applications
In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.

- <ins>Mobile Application</ins>
Application created for mobile devices.
Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.

**Java Platforms:**
- Java SE (Java Standard Edition)
    - Java programming platform
    - Includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc.
    - Includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, Collection, etc.


- Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)
    - An enterprise platform which is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications.
    - Built on the top of the Java SE platform.
    - Includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.


- Java ME (Java Micro Edition)
  Micro platform which is mainly used to develop mobile applications.

- JavaFX
  Used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a light-weight user interface API.

**Setting up Java Environment**
1. Install Java JDK in local system
2. Set path of Java (jdk/bin) in Environment Variables(Windows) & .bashrc file(Linux)
3. Verify Java setup using `java --version` && `javac --version`

```java
    class Intro {  
        public static void main(String args[]) {  
         System.out.println("Hello, JayKay12 Tech!");  
        }  
    }  
```

```console
javac Simple.java //Compiles
java Simple //Executes
```

`Internal Basic Details:`


`Valid java main method signature`

    public static void main(String[] args)  
    public static void main(String []args)  
    public static void main(String args[])  
    public static void main(String... args)  
    static public void main(String[] args)  
    public static final void main(String[] args)  
    final public static void main(String[] args)  
    final strictfp public static void main(String[] args)  

`Invalid java main method signature`

    public void main(String[] args)  
    static void main(String[] args)  
    public void static main(String[] args)  
    abstract public static void main(String[] args)

**Runtime Execution of bytecode**

![Bytecode Execution](../assets/images/J-3.png)

 - We can execute `javac Jalaz.java` having class "Tech" which after compilation will result into bytecode as `Tech.class`. But this class need not be public.

 - We can have multiple classes in a single file, each one after compiling source file will form a bytecode as `A.class`, `B.class` & `C.class`

**JDK, JRE & JVM :**

- JVM
   - Java Virtual Machine


- JRE
   - Java Runtime Environment


- JDK
   - Java Development Kit
